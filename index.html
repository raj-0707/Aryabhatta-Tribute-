      <h1 class="about">ABOUT</h1>
      <p class="who">Aryabhata was the first of the major mathematician-astronomers from the classical age of Indian Mathematics and Indian Astronomy. He is also considered as a major early physicist for his explicit mentions of relativity of motion.</p>


    </div>
    <div class="third-container">
      <h1 class="padhai">EDUCATION</h1>
      <p class="shiksha">It is presumed that he went to Kusumaputra for advanced studies and was the head of an institution there. It also widely speculated that he was also the head at University of Nalanda, Patliputra as it had an astronomical observatory.</p>

      <h1 class="kaam">WORK</h1>
      <p class="karya">Aryabhatta is the author of several treatises on Mathematics and Astronomy, some of which are lost. His major work Aryabhatiya has survived to modern times.
      It is occassionally referred to as <em>Arya-shatas-ashta</em>, which literally means "Aryabhatta's 108" as it has 108 verses in it.
    It contains 108 verses, 13 introductory verses and is divided into 4 main <em>padas</em> or chapters as follows</p>

      <h1 class="padhai">LEGACY</h1>
      <p class="karya">Aryabhata's work was of great influence in the Indian astronomical tradition and influenced several neighbouring cultures
        through translations.
      The Arabic translation during the Islamic Golden Age was particularly influential. Some of his results are cited by
       Al-Khwarizmi and in the 10th century Al-Biruni stated that Aryabhata's followers believed that the Earth rotated on its axis.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="karya">His definitions of sine, cosine, versine, and inverse sine influenced the birth of trigonometry.
       He was also the first to specify sine and versine (1 − cos x) tables,
       in 3.75° intervals from 0° to 90°, to an accuracy of 4 decimal places.</p>
       <br>
       <p class="karya">Aryabhata's astronomical calculation methods were also very influential. Along with the trigonometric tables,
         they came to be widely used in the Islamic world and used to computemany Arabic astronomical tables. In particular,
         the astronomical tables in the work of the
          Arabic Spain scientist Al-Zarqali were translated into Latin as the Tables of Toledo  and remained the most
           accurate ephemeris used in Europe for centuries. </p>
           <br>
        <p class="karya">Calendric calculations devised by Aryabhata and his followers have been in continuous
          use in India for the practical purposes of fixing the Panchangam.
          In the Islamic world, they formed the basis of the Jalali calendar introduced in 1073 CE
           by a group of astronomers including Omar Khayyam versions of which
           are the national calendars in use in Iran and Afghanistan today. The dates of the Jalali calendar
            are based on actual solar transit, as in Aryabhata and earlier Siddhanta calendars. This type of calendar
             requires an ephemeris for calculating dates. Although dates were difficult to compute, seasonal errors were less
              in the Jalali calendar than in the Gregorian calendar</p>
              <br>
              <p class="karya">Aryabhatta Knowledge University (AKU), Patna has been established by Government of Bihar for the development and management
                 of educational infrastructure related to technical, medical, management and allied professional education in his honour.
                  The university is governed by Bihar State University Act 2008.</p>
                  <br>
              <p class="karya">India's first satellite Aryabhata and the lunar crater Aryabhata are both named in his honour. An Institute for conducting
                 research in astronomy, astrophysics and atmospheric sciences is the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences
                  near Nainital, India. The inter-school Aryabhata Maths Competition is also named after him,[43] as is Bacillus aryabhata,
                   a species of bacteria discovered in the stratosphere by ISRO scientists in 2009.</p>
